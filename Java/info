Java
- Compiled language (before it is executed it needs to be compiled with a compiler)
--- Compiled Java code can run on any JVM (Java virtual machine)
--- Source Code -> Java Compiler -> Byte Code -> JVM -> (Windows, Linux, Mac)
- OOP Language, class oriented
- Static Language (code checks at compile time, setting variable types on definition)
- Strong Typed Language (cannot mix data types: string + int = error)
- Single Threaded, can explicitly create more threads
- Strengths
--- Static and Strong means its is a safe language
--- OOP makes abstraction, using design patterns and scalability easy
--- Platform independent (WORA)
--- Supports multithreading
- Weaknesses
--- Kinda slow
--- Static and Strong means its pretty verbose
--- Prone to overengineering
--- Code needs to be compiled to run
--- Paid commercial license


How to run Java:
- Windows: download IDE (intellij, eclipse), install JDK, setup IDE, run code.
- Debian:
--- Version 8:
----- apt install default-jdk
--- Version 11:
----- echo 'deb http://ftp.debian.org/debian stretch-backports main' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/stretch-backports.list
----- apt install openjdk-11-jdk
--- Oracle Java:
----- Google it.
- Execute Java options:
--- Java Starting point (class and main method):
----- public class Problems {
-----     public static void main(String[] args){
-----         System.out.println("Hello World");
-----     }
----- }
--- Compile & Run Java: `java problems.java`
